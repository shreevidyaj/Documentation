Configuration Management Process Summary
==========================================

**THIS PAGE IS CURRENTLY SERVING AS A PLACEHOLDER.  IN PROGRESS for updates.**

The configuration management process describes how to establish and maintain the integrity of program-related work products and baselines throughout the lifecycle and make them available to relevant stakeholders in time for their need. A Software Configuration Management (SCM) Plan is used to document and guide project stakeholders in the CM tools and methods used within the program.

The Configuration Management (CM) Lead is responsible to see that this process is performed.
