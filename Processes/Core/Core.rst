`Validation <../Core/Validation/Validation.html>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample description of the process/high level overview...  such as:

The process describes a sequence of activities performed to validate the software requirements.  Validation activities include reviewing each desired product Epics (committed to the release) against the acceptance criteria. The goal of this process is to confirm that the product meets the defined requirements and its acceptance criteria.
